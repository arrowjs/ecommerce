## Configuration

We tested with PostgreSQL and MySQL.
By default, Arrow CMS use PostgreSQL and Redis. If you don't have Redis or PostgreSQL modify the config file :


```
//Database config
//config/database.js
 db: {
        host: 'localhost',    // database host
        port: '5432',         // database port
        database: 'arrowjs',  // database name
        username: 'postgres', // database usename
        password: '',         // database password
        dialect: 'postgres',  // database type 
        logging: false
    },
    
```


```

//Redis cache config
//config/redis.js
redis: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: '6379',
        type: 'fakeredis'  // if you installed redis, change it to "redis".
    },
    
```

## Run CMS

Start application:

```
    node server.js
```

or

```
    npm start
